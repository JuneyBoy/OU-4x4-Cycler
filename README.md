# OU-4x4-Cycler

This was our final design project for Circuits Lab in which we had to build a circuit that would display and cycle through OU 4x4 (first four letters of last name and last 4 letters of student ID, which in my case is GANE6674) on a 14-segment LED display. We used Multisim to test the logic and EAGLE to design the PCB.
